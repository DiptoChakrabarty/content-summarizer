### About the project 
In our day to day life we often come accross long texts like terms and conditions, privacy prolicy, user manual ect. Due to their massive length we never care to read even a single line. It would be much better if we could summarise the text and show only the important things to the user. We are building a web app which uses NLP to do this task.
